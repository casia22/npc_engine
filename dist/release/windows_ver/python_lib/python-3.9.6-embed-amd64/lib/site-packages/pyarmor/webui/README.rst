pyarmor-webui
=============

pyarmor-webui is a web-ui for pyarmor. It's a tool to obfuscate python
scripts, bind obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscated
scripts.

Install by `pip`::

  pip install pyarmor-webui

Start it in the default web browser::

  pyarmor-webui

A light-weigh web server will run on default port 9096 to serve the
request of web pages. If this port is used by others, start it with
other port. For example::

  pyarmor-webui -p 9088

Only run the web server, do not open web browser::

  pyarmor-webui -n

For more options::

  pyarmor-webui -h

If it's not installed by `pip`, run `pyarmor-webui` by this way::

  python server.py

Before that make sure `pyarmor` has been installed::

  pip install pyarmor
