        ## About the Jupyter Development Team
        
        The Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.
        This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.
        
        The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
        https://github.com/jupyter/.
        
        ## Our Copyright Policy
        
        Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
        over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these
        contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter
        source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
        institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter
        Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
        changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
        their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
        change to one of the Jupyter repositories.
        
        With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
        to indicate the copyright and license terms:
        
        ```
        # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.
        # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.
        ```

_An event system for Jupyter Applications and extensions._

Jupyter Events enables Jupyter Python Applications (e.g. Jupyter Server, JupyterLab Server, JupyterHub, etc.) to emit **events**â€”structured data describing things happening inside the application. Other software (e.g. client applications like JupyterLab) can _listen_ and respond to these events.

## Install

Install Jupyter Events directly from PyPI:

```
pip install jupyter_events
```

or conda-forge:

```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_events
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [jupyter-events.readthedocs.io](https://jupyter-events.readthedocs.io).
